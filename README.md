## Mission  
Offspring enhances fertility tracking through Apple’s ecosystem, offering intelligent, data-driven reproductive health insights. Built with inclusivity and user-centric design at its core, Offspring bridges the gap between modern tech and diverse fertility needs.

## The Problem  
Current fertility apps rely on outdated, one-size-fits-all models that:  
- Lack accuracy for users with irregular cycles or hormonal conditions  
- Exclude LGBTQ+ users and nontraditional family planning  
- Depend heavily on manual input, reducing long-term engagement

## The Solution  
Offspring uses Apple Watch biometrics, Apple HealthKit, and machine learning to deliver:  
- Real-time pattern recognition based on personal biometric data  
- Inclusive design for LGBTQ+ users and those managing hormonal conditions  
- Seamless Apple integration to reduce friction and improve tracking accuracy  

## Meet Stu the Stork  
Stu is Offspring’s AI-powered fertility concierge. He helps users:  
- Understand trends in their cycle data  
- Learn about fertility concepts through conversational education  
- Get inclusive, empathetic support—without judgment  

Stu is not a doctor (he’s a stork), but he’s trained to speak embryologist-inspired logic in clean, developer-friendly style.
