## Mission Statement  
Offspring leverages Apple’s ecosystem to provide intelligent, data-driven fertility insights—enhancing reproductive health tracking with precision, inclusivity, and seamless integration.

## The Problem  
Current fertility tracking solutions lack accuracy, inclusivity, and predictive intelligence. Many apps rely on generalized data models that fail to accommodate diverse reproductive health needs, including irregular cycles, hormonal conditions, and LGBTQ+ family planning.

Offspring enhances fertility tracking by utilizing Apple Watch biometrics, machine learning, and Apple Health’s extensive dataset to provide:  
- **Real-time predictive insights** based on personal biometric patterns.  
- **LGBTQ+ and medical condition inclusivity** for a more comprehensive fertility model.  
- **Apple Watch & iPhone integration**, reducing reliance on manual input and increasing accuracy.
