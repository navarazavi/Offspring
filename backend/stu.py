                {"question": "How do I know when I'm most fertile?", "answer": "The most fertile time is typically during ovulation, which occurs around 14 days before your next period."},
                {"question": "How can I improve my fertility?", "answer": "Maintain a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, exercise, stress management, and proper medical care."},
                {"question": "What is IVF?", "answer": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a procedure where eggs are fertilized outside the body before being implanted in the uterus."},
                # Add more advanced fertility-related questions here...
                {"question": "What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?", 
                 "answer": "PCOS is a common hormonal disorder that can affect ovulation and fertility. It can cause irregular periods, high levels of androgens (male hormones), and cysts on the ovaries."},
    
                {"question": "How does age affect fertility?", 
                 "answer": "Fertility naturally declines with age, particularly for women. Women's egg quantity and quality decrease with age, and men may experience reduced sperm quality after age 40."},
    
                {"question": "What are fallopian tube blockages and how do they affect fertility?", 
                 "answer": "Blockages in the fallopian tubes prevent the egg from meeting the sperm, which can lead to infertility. Causes may include infections, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or endometriosis."},
    
                {"question": "What is endometriosis?", 
                 "answer": "Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus. It can cause pain, scarring, and infertility by affecting the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and pelvic tissue."},
    
                {"question": "What is the role of luteal phase defect in fertility?", 
                 "answer": "A luteal phase defect occurs when the second half of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase) is shorter than normal, which can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg."},
    
                {"question": "Can stress affect fertility?", 
                 "answer": "Yes, high stress can interfere with hormone regulation, affecting ovulation and sperm production. Reducing stress through relaxation techniques can improve fertility."},
    
                {"question": "What is sperm motility?", 
                 "answer": "Sperm motility refers to the sperm's ability to move efficiently. Poor motility can decrease the chances of sperm reaching the egg, affecting fertility."},
    
                {"question": "What are the signs of low testosterone in men?", 
                 "answer": "Signs of low testosterone in men include low energy, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. Treatment options may involve hormone therapy."},

                {"question": "How does body weight affect fertility?", 
                 "answer": "Both low and high body weight can affect fertility. Extreme weight fluctuations can interfere with ovulation and sperm production. Maintaining a healthy weight is key for fertility."},
    
                {"question": "What is the impact of alcohol on fertility?", 
                 "answer": "Heavy alcohol consumption can interfere with hormone production, ovulation, and sperm health. It's recommended to limit alcohol intake when trying to conceive."},

                 "answer": "Egg freezing is the process of preserving a womanâ€™s eggs for future use, often used for women who want to delay childbearing due to medical or personal reasons."},
    
                {"question": "What are uterine fibroids and how do they affect fertility?", 
                 "answer": "Uterine fibroids are benign tumors in the uterus that can interfere with implantation, cause miscarriage, or obstruct the fallopian tubes, impacting fertility."},
    
                {"question": "What is a chemical pregnancy?", 
                 "answer": "A chemical pregnancy occurs when an embryo is fertilized but does not implant properly, often leading to a very early miscarriage that might go unnoticed."},

                 "answer": "You can track ovulation through methods like tracking your menstrual cycle, using ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), basal body temperature, and cervical mucus monitoring."},

                 "answer": "Sperm count refers to the concentration of sperm in a manâ€™s semen. Low sperm count can affect fertility by reducing the chances of the sperm reaching and fertilizing an egg."}
